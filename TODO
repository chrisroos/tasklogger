* add a readme

* think about data loss

* make it easy to append data to the current task

* it's easy to lose data when editing by hand and forgetting to surround fields-with-comments in quotes

* warn/prompt when starting a new task and the old task was edited yesterday/more than X hours ago

* make it easy to edit existing entries - to make it harder to create malformed csv that might get destroyed

* warn/refuse to write the csv if the existing file contains invalid csv (i.e. if there are not exactly X columns on each row) - this should help prevent accidentally overwriting the existing data

* resume should emit the task that's being resumed

* add reporting to tasklogger command

* make it easy to amend the most recent entry

* offer a pause option?

* sync the tasks with a remote server??

* Generate a weekly report:
